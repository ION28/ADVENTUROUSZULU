# ADVENTUROUSZULU 

## Background

The cloud, like most enterprise-ready platforms and software, is highly complex. Azure is certainly no exception. In addition though, unlike other providers such as AWS, Azure is built by an organization with more than two decades of experience in the identity space. 

So what does that practically mean for securing Azure deployments? Well for starters it means you'll need to understand, work with, and manage the numerous types of identities within Azure. 

These include obvious credentials such as the ones for an Azure Active Directory user that are used to log into portal.azure.com. But there are also other types such as Service Principals, Storage Account Keys, SAS tokens, Managed Identities, Registered Applications, Azure Container Registry Access Keys, and more. Additionally, you'll come across these secrets stored in many different forms from Authorization Bearer JWTs to Storage Account Connection Strings. 

## Mission

This project aims to aid security personnel working with Azure in a couple of ways. First, ADVENTUROUSZULU supports simply enumerating all of the resources a provided set of credentials has access to and at what permission level. This can be used for basic situational awareness and to identify opportunities to apply stronger least privileged access controls. Second, the tool is designed to spot potential lateral movement paths for attackers and highlight possible misconfigurations, especially those related to identity.
